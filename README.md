## Problem / Solution

**Problem:**  
Creating modern desktop applications requires a stable, modular architecture, cross-platform compatibility, and an automated build process. Traditional Eclipse RCP apps often rely on old tools or manual setup, which slows down development.

**Solution:**  
A lightweight, Maven-based Eclipse RCP project structure — using Tycho and Java 21  — that supports cross-platform builds, clean packaging, and update sites. Easily extensible for large desktop apps.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
- **Modular Architecture:** Uses Eclipse RCP’s plugin/feature model with OSGi.  
- **Modern Java Support:** Compatible with Java 21 and Eclipse 2025-06.  
- **Reproducible Builds:** Uses Maven + Tycho with a versioned target platform.  
- **Update Site Support:** Generates p2 repositories and zip archives for easy distribution and updates.
